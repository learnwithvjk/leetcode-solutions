# leetcode-solutions

An open-source competitive programs testing tool.

## Testing inputs

Make sure python is installed in your device, if not follow the [instructions given here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-python-3-latest-version/)

To run tests:
> cd program-lists
> python test-run-all.py 

This will ask for integer inputs on which service, problem and solution

For Example to execute, leet code problem 5's 2nd solution:
Service -> 1
Problem -> 5
Solution -> 2

Providing these inputs will run the tests

## NOTE:

Currently Testing scripts will only support primitive inputs (int, string, list, dict) and python language alone. Will be supporting them in future releases.
